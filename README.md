This repository contains our machine learning classification project for predicting income levels using the UCI Adult Income dataset. It includes four well-documented Jupyter notebooks, each dedicated to a specific model: Perceptron, Adaline, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Each notebook walks through preprocessing steps (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and standardizing numerical features), model training, performance evaluation, and prediction on validation inputs. We also visualize decision boundaries and analyze algorithm behavior across different hyperparameters. The repository supports our final presentation and includes all deliverables required for evaluation.
